# Dong, Lei et al. (2020), Data from: Phylogenetic structure and formation mechanism of shrub 
# communities in arid and semi-arid areas of the Mongolian Plateau, Dryad, Dataset, 
# https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6m905qfvv

# This paper studied the phylogenetic structure of the shrub communities in arid and semiarid 
# areas of the Mongolian Plateau. The main variables within the dataset "Traits.csv" are the 
# phylogenetic signals of the height(cm), canopy (m2), leaf length (cm) and leaf width (mm) of 
# studied shrubs and subshrubs.

MyData <- read.csv("./Traits.csv")
